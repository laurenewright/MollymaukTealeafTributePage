            <p>Molly is a genderfluid lavender tiefling with red eyes. His curled horns were pierced and extremely ostentatious, with little gems and baubles. His flamboyant appearance was often commented upon. He wore a bright and colorful robe covered with religious symbols. Molly was introduced with two swords and a pouch that dangled from his hips. He also had many straight, overlapping scars on his neck, upper chest, and arms, presumably from drawing his own blood to activate his swords. Molly had a light Irish accent, though whether Lucien also shared this accent or it was something Molly developed on his own is unknown.</p>
